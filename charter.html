					<h3>Tholian Charter</h3>
					<p>
						The Tholian Charter reflects the Ideals and Values of our Community.
					</p>
					<p>
						Those who do not abide by the rules manifested in the Tholian Charter
						may be warned, banned or in repeated violations even permanently
						excluded from the Tholian Network.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>1. Be correct; we do not tolerate deceit.</h3>
					<p>
						We do not tolerate deception of any kind. Malicious actors that abuse
						the power of Knowledge to harm or manipulate others for their own
						advantage will not be tolerated.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>2. Be respectful.</h3>
					<p>
						We are a community diverse of ethnicity, race, religion and gender but
						united in solidarity as a species.
					</p>
					<p>
						It does not matter who or what you are, we treat each other with respect
						and tolerance. Be respectful to each other in opinions and welcome your
						counterpart in the challenge of debates.
					</p>
					<p>
						We as a community also embrace the <a target="_blank" href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-echr-17">Convention on Human Rights</a>
						of the European Union as a fundamental guideline on how to interact with
						each other.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>3. Be curious.</h3>
					<p>
						We embrace curiosity and knowledge. There are no stupid questions,
						only stupid answers. We encourage those who seek out for knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>
						We listen with curiosity, we speak with honesty and we act with integrity.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>4. Be compassionate.</h3>
					<p>
						We embrace love and respect over hate and despair.
					</p>
					<p>
						When we see someone do a good deed, we support them with joy and delight.
						When we see someone unfortunate, we support them with dignity to recover
						good fortune.
					</p>
					<p>
						When someone comes to do us harm, we will encounter them with forgiveness
						and we will not harbor thoughts of revenge.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>5. Embrace rationality.</h3>
					<p>
						We embrace reasoning based on rationality and therefore realize the
						potential of abusing appeals to emotions for manipulative goals.
					</p>
					<p>
						We do not tolerate deception, which includes an appeal to emotions
						without providing the necessary facts as evidence.
					</p>
					<p>
						We counteract anger and its potential as a thought infiltration
						technique with compassion and rationality.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>6. Require evidence.</h3>
					<p>
						We reason based on evidence. If there's a claim for right or wrong,
						traceable and verifyable evidence is necessary to provide in a debate.
					</p>
					<p>
						The State of Knowledge can be challenged, but requires evidence.
						Without evidence, there can be no claim.
